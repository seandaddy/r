## Data

This data is SAT scores and GPA for every student who entered the University of Texas at Austin at 2000 and graduated within 6 years. As a two-way ANOVA model, we want to analyze the impact from 2 factor variables as well as the interaction between them.

```{r sat}
sat = read.csv("ut2000.csv")
attach(sat)
tapply(SAT.C, list(Gender,School),mean)
boxplot(SAT.Q~Gender+School, col="blue", data=sat)
interaction.plot(Gender, School, SAT.Q, col=c("blue","red"))

out=lm(SAT.Q~Gender*School,data=sat)
out1=lm(SAT.Q~Gender+School+Gender*School,data=sat)
out2=lm(SAT.Q~Gender+School,data=sat)

anova(out)
summary(out1)
summary(out2)

par(mfrow=c(2,2))
plot(out)
```
